## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Company Name Not Detected

1. Open browser console (F12) on LinkedIn page
2. Filter logs by "LinkedIn Scraper"
3. Check which selector is being used
4. Use manual input field as fallback

### CSV Upload Fails

- Error: "Resource::kQuotaBytes quota exceeded"
  - **Fixed!** Now uses IndexedDB instead of chrome.storage
  - Supports files 12MB+ without issues

### Visa Check Shows Wrong Companies

- The matching algorithm is strict for short names (‚â§5 characters)
- For "Teya", only matches companies with core name exactly "Teya"
- Won't match "Teya Technologies" or "Teya Systems"

### AI Summary Not Working

1. Check API key in Options
2. Verify prompt is configured
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Try clicking "Stop ChatGPT" and retry
