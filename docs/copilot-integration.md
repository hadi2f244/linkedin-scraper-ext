## üîê Authentication Details

### What Permissions Are Requested?

The extension requests minimal permissions:
- **Scope**: `read:user` - Only reads your basic GitHub profile information
- **No code access**: The extension does NOT access your repositories or code
- **No write permissions**: Cannot modify anything on your GitHub account

### How Authentication Works

The extension uses GitHub's **Device Flow OAuth**:

1. **Device Code Request**: Extension requests a device code from GitHub
2. **User Authorization**: You manually authorize on GitHub's website
3. **Access Token**: After authorization, extension receives an access token
4. **Copilot Token**: Access token is exchanged for a Copilot session token
5. **Secure Storage**: Tokens are stored locally in Chrome's secure storage

### Token Security

- ‚úÖ Tokens stored in Chrome's encrypted storage
- ‚úÖ Never transmitted to third parties
- ‚úÖ Only used to communicate with GitHub's official APIs
- ‚úÖ Can be revoked anytime from GitHub settings

---

- **"‚úì Authenticated"** (green) = Ready to use
