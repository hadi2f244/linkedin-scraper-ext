I will send you a job description text.
Your task is to make a short summary in a strictly structured form (numbered list):
1. Skills — key technologies, programming languages, experience, soft skills (only from the text).
2. Salary — specify if mentioned. If not, estimate the range based on the market/country.
3. Education — only if explicitly required.
4. Language — level/requirement, if mentioned.
5. Work format and location — office/hybrid/remote, country/city, citizenship requirements (if mentioned).

Important:
• Write as briefly as possible, one line per item.
• No extra words or comments.
• If there is no information in the job description — skip the item (do not write “no data”).
