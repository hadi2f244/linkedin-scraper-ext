I will send you a job description text.

Your task is to summarize it in a strictly structured and concise form (numbered list).
The summary must help identify DevOps/SRE positions in the UK that explicitly offer or possibly provide visa sponsorship.

Output format (in English, no extra comments or words):
1. Skills — key technologies, programming languages, tools, and soft skills (only from the text).
2. Salary — stated or estimated based on UK market norms.
3. Education — only if explicitly required.
4. Language — level/requirement, if mentioned.
5. Work format & location — office/hybrid/remote, city/country, citizenship/residency requirements if any.
6. Visa Sponsorship — clearly highlight if sponsorship is explicitly offered. If not mentioned, write “Not mentioned” or “Possibly available” with a short reason (e.g. “large tech company likely to sponsor”).

Important:
• Focus only on DevOps/SRE or infrastructure-related roles (Kubernetes, Golang, IaC, AWS/GCP, CI/CD, etc.).
• Include only UK-based roles (England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland). Remote or hybrid acceptable if UK-based.
• Skip any item not present in the text (do NOT write “no data”).
• Keep each point one line long.
• Be clear, short, and factual.
