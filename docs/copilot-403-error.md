# GitHub Copilot 403 Error - Troubleshooting Guide

## The Problem

When trying to use the GitHub Copilot integration, you may encounter a **403 Forbidden** error with a message like:

```json
{
  "message": "Resource not accessible by integration",
  "error_details": {
    "notification_id": "feature_flag_blocked",
    "message": "Contact Support. You are currently logged in as [username]."
  }
}
```

## Why This Happens

The GitHub Copilot API (`https://api.github.com/copilot_internal/v2/token`) is an **internal API** that requires:

1. ‚úÖ **Active GitHub Copilot Subscription** - You must have a paid GitHub Copilot subscription
2. ‚úÖ **Copilot Feature Enabled** - The feature must be enabled on your GitHub account
3. ‚úÖ **Proper OAuth Scopes** - The authentication token must have the correct permissions

### Common Causes

- ‚ùå **No Copilot Subscription**: Your GitHub account doesn't have an active Copilot subscription
- ‚ùå **Free GitHub Account**: GitHub Copilot requires a paid subscription (individual or through organization)
- ‚ùå **Organization Restrictions**: Your organization may not have enabled Copilot for your account
- ‚ùå **Trial Expired**: Your Copilot trial period has ended

## How to Check Your Copilot Status

1. Visit [GitHub Copilot Settings](https://github.com/settings/copilot)
2. Check if you see:
   - ‚úÖ **"GitHub Copilot is active"** - You have access
   - ‚ùå **"Get GitHub Copilot"** - You need to subscribe

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Subscribe to GitHub Copilot (Recommended if you want Copilot)

1. Visit [GitHub Copilot Pricing](https://github.com/features/copilot)
2. Choose a plan:
   - **Individual**: $10/month or $100/year
   - **Business**: $19/user/month
   - **Enterprise**: Contact sales
3. Complete the subscription process
4. Return to the extension and try authenticating again

### Solution 2: Use OpenAI API (Recommended Alternative)

OpenAI's official API is more reliable and doesn't require a Copilot subscription:

1. Open the extension **Options** page
2. Change **AI Provider** to **"OpenAI (Custom API Key)"**
3. Get an API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
4. Enter your API key in the extension options
5. Save settings

**Pricing**: Pay-as-you-go, typically $0.002-0.03 per request depending on model

### Solution 3: Use Free Alternatives (Best for Budget)

The extension supports free AI providers:

#### Option A: Groq (Recommended)
1. Open extension **Options**
2. Select **"Groq (Free Alternative - Recommended)"**
3. Get a free API key from [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/)
4. Enter the API key
5. Save settings

**Benefits**: 
- ‚úÖ Free tier available
- ‚úÖ Fast inference
- ‚úÖ Works globally

#### Option B: Hugging Face
1. Open extension **Options**
2. Select **"Hugging Face (Free Alternative)"**
3. Get a free API key from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
4. Enter the API key
5. Save settings

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Free tier available
- ‚úÖ Open source models
- ‚úÖ No credit card required

## Understanding the Error Response

When you see this error in the network inspector:

```
Request URL: https://api.github.com/copilot_internal/v2/token
Status Code: 403 Forbidden

Response:
{
  "can_signup_for_limited": false,
  "error_details": {
    "notification_id": "feature_flag_blocked",
    "message": "Contact Support. You are currently logged in as hadi2f2-bot."
  }
}
```

This means:
- ‚úÖ Authentication succeeded (you're logged in)
- ‚ùå Copilot access denied (no subscription or feature not enabled)
- üîí The `feature_flag_blocked` notification indicates Copilot is not available for your account

## Updated Extension Behavior

The extension now provides better error handling:

### During Authentication
When you authenticate with GitHub, the extension will:
1. Complete the OAuth flow
2. **Verify Copilot access** by testing the API
3. Show one of these messages:
   - ‚úÖ **"Authentication successful! Copilot access verified."** - Ready to use
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **"Authenticated but Copilot not available"** - Need to subscribe or switch providers

### During Usage
When you click "Send to ChatGPT" or "Generate Cover Letter":
- If Copilot is not available, you'll see a clear error message
- The message includes a link to switch to alternative providers
- No confusing 403 errors without explanation

## FAQ

### Q: I authenticated successfully, why doesn't it work?
**A**: Authentication only verifies your GitHub identity. Copilot access requires an active subscription.

### Q: Can I use GitHub Copilot for free?
**A**: GitHub Copilot offers a free trial, but requires a paid subscription after that. Use Groq or Hugging Face for free alternatives.

### Q: Will my authentication token work later if I subscribe?
**A**: Yes! Once you subscribe to Copilot, your existing authentication should work without re-authenticating.

### Q: Is it safe to use alternative providers?
**A**: Yes! OpenAI, Groq, and Hugging Face are all legitimate AI providers. Your data is sent directly to them, not through any third parties.

### Q: Which provider should I choose?
- **GitHub Copilot**: Best if you already have a subscription
- **OpenAI**: Most reliable, pay-as-you-go pricing
- **Groq**: Best free option, fast and reliable
- **Hugging Face**: Good free option, open source models

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints
- **Device Auth**: `https://github.com/login/device/code` ‚úÖ Public
- **Token Exchange**: `https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token` ‚úÖ Public
- **Copilot Token**: `https://api.github.com/copilot_internal/v2/token` ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires subscription
- **Chat API**: `https://api.githubcopilot.com/chat/completions` ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires subscription

### OAuth Scopes
The extension requests: `read:user`

This is sufficient for authentication but doesn't grant Copilot access without a subscription.

## Need Help?

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. Check [GitHub Copilot Status](https://www.githubstatus.com/)
2. Review [GitHub Copilot Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot)
3. Contact GitHub Support if you believe you should have access
4. Open an issue in the extension repository with:
   - Your GitHub account type (free/pro/enterprise)
   - Whether you have a Copilot subscription
   - The exact error message you're seeing

## Summary

**The 403 error is expected behavior** when you don't have a GitHub Copilot subscription. The extension now handles this gracefully and guides you to alternative solutions.

**Recommended Action**: Switch to Groq or OpenAI in the extension options for a better experience.
