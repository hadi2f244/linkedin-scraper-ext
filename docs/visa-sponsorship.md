## Matching Algorithm

### How Matching Works

The extension uses a sophisticated algorithm to handle company name variations.

### Step 1: Normalization

**Purpose:** Make names comparable

**Process:**
```javascript
"Google UK Ltd." ‚Üí "google uk ltd"
"IBM (United Kingdom)" ‚Üí "ibm united kingdom"
"Barclays Bank PLC" ‚Üí "barclays bank plc"
```

**What's removed:**
- Special characters: `.`, `,`, `(`, `)`, `&`
- Extra whitespace
- Case differences

### Step 2: Core Name Extraction

**Purpose:** Get the essential company name

**Removed suffixes:**
- Limited, Ltd, LTD
- PLC, plc
- LLC, Inc, Corporation, Corp
- Company, Co
- Group, Holdings
- International, Intl
- UK, USA, US, Europe, Global

**Examples:**
```javascript
"google uk ltd" ‚Üí "google"
"ibm united kingdom limited" ‚Üí "ibm"
"barclays bank plc" ‚Üí "barclays bank"
```

### Step 3: Matching & Scoring

**Exact Match (100 points):**
- Normalized names are identical
- Example: "google" === "google"

**Core Match (90 points):**
- Core names are identical
- Example: "google" === "google uk limited" (both core to "google")

**Starts With (80 points):**
- One name starts with the other
- Example: "google" starts "google cloud"

**Contains (50 points):**
- One name contains the other
- Example: "google" in "alphabet google"

### Step 4: Filtering

**Short Name Rule:**
- Names ‚â§ 5 characters require exact core match
- Prevents false matches like "IBM" ‚Üí "IBM Technologies"

**Example:**
- Search: "Teya" (4 chars)
- ‚úÖ Matches: "Teya", "Teya Ltd", "Teya Limited"
- ‚ùå Doesn't match: "Teya Technologies", "Teya Systems"

**Long Name Rule:**
- Names > 5 characters use flexible matching
- Allows variations and subsidiaries

### Step 5: Ranking

**Top 5 results:**
- Sorted by score (highest first)
- Exact matches always first
- Ties broken by name length (shorter first)

## Troubleshooting

### Company Name Not Detected

**Symptom:** Input field is empty

**Solutions:**
1. Wait 2-3 seconds for auto-detection
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Use manual input field
4. Click "Refresh Job Data"

**Debug:**
- Open console (F12) on LinkedIn page
- Filter by "LinkedIn Scraper"
- See which selectors are tried

### Wrong Company Matched

**Symptom:** Results show unrelated companies

**Solutions:**
1. Check match quality indicator
2. Look at "Possible Match" results carefully
3. Verify company location matches job
4. Use manual search with full company name

**Example:**
- Job says "Google Cloud"
- Results show "Google UK Limited" (Exact Match) ‚úÖ
- And "Google Cloud UK Limited" (High Match) ‚úÖ
- Second result is more specific

### Too Many Results

**Symptom:** 5 results, all seem different

**Cause:** Common company name or abbreviation

**Solutions:**
1. Check job posting for full legal name
2. Look at location to narrow down
3. Check company website for legal name
4. Use LinkedIn company page for official name

### No Results for Known Sponsor

**Symptom:** Company should be sponsor but not found

**Possible causes:**
1. **Name mismatch**: Legal name differs from brand name
   - Example: Job says "Google" but registered as "Google UK Limited"
   - Solution: Try variations

2. **CSV outdated**: Company recently added/removed
   - Solution: Download latest CSV

3. **Subsidiary**: Job is for subsidiary not parent company
   - Example: "Google Cloud" vs "Google UK"
   - Solution: Search for both

4. **Typo**: Company name misspelled
   - Solution: Check spelling

### CSV Upload Fails

**Error: "Error reading file"**

**Solutions:**
1. Verify file is CSV format
2. Check file isn't corrupted
3. Re-download from government site
4. Try different browser

**Error: "Resource::kQuotaBytes quota exceeded"**

**This should NOT happen** (we use IndexedDB, not chrome.storage)

**If you see this:**
- Extension code has a bug
- Report on GitHub
- Check you're using latest version
