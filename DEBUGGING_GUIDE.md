## Troubleshooting

### Problem 1: "No job cards found"
**Console shows:**
```
[Badge Scanner] Found 0 job cards
[Badge Scanner] ‚ö†Ô∏è No job cards found! Checking if page structure exists...
[Badge Scanner] List container exists: false
```

**Solution:**
- The page hasn't loaded yet
- Wait a few more seconds and check console again
- Try refreshing the page
- Make sure you're on the jobs page, not the job details page

### Problem 2: "Badge scanner is disabled"
**Console shows:**
```
[Badge Scanner] ‚ö†Ô∏è Badge scanner is disabled in settings
[Badge Scanner] badgeSettings: {enabled: false, ...}
```

**Solution:**
1. Click the extension icon in Chrome toolbar
2. Click "Options"
3. Check "Enable automatic badge scanning on job listings"
4. Click "Save Settings"
5. Refresh the LinkedIn page

### Problem 3: "No insertion points found"
**Console shows:**
```
[Badge Scanner] Found metadata: false
[Badge Scanner] Found caption: false
[Badge Scanner] Found content: false
[Badge Scanner] ‚ö†Ô∏è No insertion points found, using fallback...
```

**Solution:**
- LinkedIn may have changed their HTML structure
- Check the actual HTML in DevTools Elements tab
- Look for elements with classes: `.artdeco-entity-lockup__metadata`, `.artdeco-entity-lockup__caption`

### Problem 4: Badges not visible
**Console shows badges were inserted but you don't see them:**

**Solution:**
1. Check if badges have CSS styling:
   - Open DevTools Elements tab
   - Find `.linkedin-job-badge-container`
   - Check if it has `display: flex` and proper styling
   
2. Check if badges are hidden behind other elements:
   - Look for `z-index` issues
   - Check if parent elements have `overflow: hidden`

3. Inspect the badge HTML:
   - Should see: `<div class="linkedin-job-badge-container">...</div>`
   - Inside should be: `<span class="linkedin-job-badge">...</span>`

## Manual Testing Commands

You can run these in the DevTools console to test manually:

### Check if job cards exist:
```javascript
document.querySelectorAll('li.scaffold-layout__list-item[data-occludable-job-id]').length
```

### Get first job ID:
```javascript
document.querySelector('li.scaffold-layout__list-item[data-occludable-job-id]').getAttribute('data-occludable-job-id')
```

### Check if badge settings are loaded:
```javascript
chrome.storage.local.get(['ENABLE_BADGE_SCANNER', 'ENABLE_VISA_BADGE', 'BADGE_KEYWORDS'], (result) => {
  console.log('Settings:', result);
});
```

### Force a scan:
```javascript
// This won't work directly because functions are in content script scope
// But you can reload the extension to trigger a new scan
```

## Success Indicators

‚úÖ **Everything is working if you see:**
1. Console shows: `Found X job cards` (where X > 0)
2. Console shows: `‚úì Badge scanner is enabled`
3. Console shows: `‚úì Badges inserted after metadata`
4. Badges appear on job cards below the salary/location info
5. Badges have proper styling (colored background, white text)

## Common Issues

### Issue: Extension not loading
- Check `chrome://extensions/` - make sure extension is enabled
- Check for errors in the extension's background page console

### Issue: Settings not saving
- Check extension options page
- Make sure you click "Save Settings"
- Check console for errors

### Issue: Badges appear but disappear
- LinkedIn may be re-rendering the job cards
- The MutationObserver should re-add badges
- Check console for "New job cards detected" messages

## Next Steps

If badges still don't appear after following this guide:
1. Share the complete console output
2. Share a screenshot of the job card HTML (from DevTools Elements tab)
3. Share the extension settings (from Options page)
